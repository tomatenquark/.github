# Tomatenquark

Tomatenquark is a fork of the open-source First-Person-Shooter Cube 2: Sauerbraten, a fast-paced shooting game featuring an in-game map editor.
In contrast to Sauerbraten, Tomatenquark strives to stay open to improvements and suggestions.
The goal of this project is to be more flexible and create an environment where development is easy, fast and where creativity can prosper.

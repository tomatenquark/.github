# Contributing to Tomatenquark

You have already accomplished the first step by reading these contribution guidelines. Congratz!

The second step is only slightly harder by joining us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/47rkQar).

To contribute to the project and merge your changes into the master branch you need to convince enough members that the changes are an improvement. It probably won't be an issue. However you should still communicate what you're doing and why you are doing it and of course take feedback and tips from others into account.

More information about the contributing process can be found [here]().
